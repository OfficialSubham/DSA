Find out how many times the array has been rotated

if you carefully notice many rotated array you could easily find a pattern

There is a relation btw the idx and minimum number in the  array

so you just have to find the minimum number in the array and ultimately return the idx of that number as it will be the times rotated number

if the  array contain duplicate

just apply the thought process of rotated sorted array II

where mid high ans low same so increase low and derease the high until

TC -> O(log2 N);
SC -> O(1);
