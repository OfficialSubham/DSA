Moore's voting algorithm

  Thaught process of this algorithm is
  think that if the number present in the array
  is greater than n/2 then according to this algo it cannot reduced
  to zero

  you have to take few variable
  if the count is 0 assign the Element to the current index
  then check weather the next element is equal to the previous one
  if so then increase the count if not decrease the count
  this will work better on while loop i guess
