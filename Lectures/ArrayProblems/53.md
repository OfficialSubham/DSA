53. Maximum Subarray

We have to find the maximum sum in the subarray

Brute ->
  Just run three loops so that you can get each subarray

TC -> nearly about O(n*n*n)
SC -> O(1)

Better ->
  Use two loops cause each time it just adds the next element
  You could easily understand if you carefully notice that.

TC -> O(n*n)
SC -> O(1)

Optimal ->
  Check the Kadane's algo in the algo file

TC -> O(N);
SC -> O(1)
