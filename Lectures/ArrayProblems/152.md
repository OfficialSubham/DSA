152. Maximum Product Subarray

In this problem i have to find the maximum product of a subarray

Brute ->
  Use you brain
  it is just three typical for loops

TC -> O(N*N*N);
SC -> O(1);

Better ->
  It can also be done using two loops
  Try to remember maximum sum of a subarray problem

TC -> O(N*N);
SC -> O(1);

Optimal ->

  1) Observation Based ->
      The array can be of different types

      a) All are +ve
      b) Even -ve, all +ve
      c) odd -ve, all +ve
      d) Contains 0

    You will get that if you think clearly
    it can be done using two pointers
    one starting from 0th index upto the last
    other starting from last upto 0th index
    the product will either the prefix i.e. the left portion
    or the suffix the right portion

    you just product everytime while iterating through the array
    if prefix or suffix becomes zero just change it to 1
    as carrying zero further doesnot make any sense

TC -> O(N);
SC -> O(1);

Code ->

        int prefix = 1;
        int suffix = 1;
        int n = nums.size();
        int i = 0;
        int j = n - 1;
        int maxi = INT_MIN;
        while(i < n && j >= 0) {
            prefix *= nums[i];
            suffix *= nums[j];
            maxi = max(prefix, maxi);
            maxi = max(suffix, maxi);
            if(prefix == 0) {
                prefix = 1;
            }
            if(suffix == 0) {
                suffix = 1;
            }
            j--;
            i++;
        }
        return maxi;
