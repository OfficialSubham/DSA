  This is a three pointer approach
  condition -> a) 0 to low - 1 is 0
               b) low to mid - 1 is 1
               c) mid to high is random
               d) high + 1 to n - 1 is 2

  now we have to solve from mid to high - 1

  there will be three cases
  1st
   arr[i] = 0

   swap with the low and increase the low
   mid++

  2nd
  arr[i] = 1

  it is kind of sorted cause all the left element is sorted
  so just move the mid pointer

  3rd
  arr[i] = 2
  swap with high and decrease the pointer
