Follow up questions for finding pascal's triangle

1) Given Row and column find what number is at that position
  in that pascals triangle

2) Print the nth row of pascals triangle

3) Print the entire pascals triangle for nth row

For the first problem
-> Formula nCr of mathematics
  the expanded formula is n!/r! * (n - r)!
  here the n is Row number - 1 and r is Column number - 1
  It will iterate fully so avoid to use this
TC -> O(n);

  If you carefully observed  you will notice that n - r factorial
  in the bottom will get cut from the top and the remaining
  will be always the number of r factorial
  For example
    7C2
    7*6*5*4*3*2*1/ (2 * 1 ) * (5*4*3*2*1)
    7*6/2*1
  from the above example it means that the number could be multiply
  upto the r value when we decrease it by 1

  define a function where we take n and r the outer loop will run upto r
  the resultant will be resultant * n - i;
  again the resultant will be resultant / i + 1

TC -> O(r);
SC -> O(n);

For the second problem

first row contains 1 element
2nd row contains 2 element

hence nth row contains n elements

It actually can be done by using the above principle
run a loop upto n time then each time pass the row number and column
number

Optimal way ->
  use zero base indexing cause it will help
  formula ->
    ans * (row - col) / col

  first take ans = 1
  each time increase the column number by 1
  and apply the formula

TC -> O(N);
SC -> O(1)

For the third problem just use these above approach in order
to get your suitable answers

HINT : use the optimal way
