485 Max consecutive ones

I have to find maximum number of 1 in a chain.

My approach (Brute force approach) ->
I take two variable
1st one to store the maximum
2nd one to store the current chain
while going to the array if 0 comes
I checks weather the current chain longer then the maximum
if so then i will replace them and set the current chain to
0 to start a new chain
if not i just set the current chain to 0 to start a new chain.

TC -> O(N)
SC -> o(1)
