In this problem i have to find out the maximum nesting depth of parentheses

Brute/Optimal ->
  Just think it like this (I solve this in one try using my own thought
  process) just take two variable where one is storing the maxi and other
  storing the current num of parentheses

Like think it in this way if it is a opening bracket then increase the current cnt and check weather it is greater than maxi
else if it is a closing bracket then just decrease the current;

TC -> O(N);
SC -> O(1);

Code ->
   int maxDepth(string s) {
        int current = 0;
        int maxi = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if(s[i] == '(') {
                current++;
                maxi = max(current, maxi);
            }
            else if(s[i] == ')') {
                current--;
            }
        }
        return maxi;
    }
