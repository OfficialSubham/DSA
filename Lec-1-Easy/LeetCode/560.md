This problem states that i have to find the total number of
a given number occured in the array
like how many subarrays could be formed in order to make get that number

My approach (used gpt for hint) ->
  Brute force just like previous one positive and negative
  use three loops.
  It can also be done using two loops

Better and Optimal at the same time ->
  Use hashing
  only one loop is needed and few variable try to remember
  inside the loop first check weather the sum == given number
  then increase the count
  if not then check weather the number sum - k occur previousy
  if so then check how many times it occur and add it to the count
  at last always store the sum with the occurence in a map in order
  to check in the future.

TC -> O(n)
SC -> O(n) in order to store the elements in the map
