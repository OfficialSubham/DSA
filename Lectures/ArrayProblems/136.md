136. Find Single number

Brute Approach ->
Two for loops inside one checking the occurrence of the number in the arr[i] of the outside loops
if there is only one occurrence then return it
else iterate

TC -> O(N*N)
SC -> O(1)

My Approach (Optimal) ->
One loop for making a map out of the array
then another loop to check the occurrence
if the occurrence is one then return it

TC -> O(2N)
SC -> O(N)

Better Approach ->
Use xor then it will return the Single element
but if the occurrence of the element is more than 2 like odd number then it cannot be Use

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(1)
