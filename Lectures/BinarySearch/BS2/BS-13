In this problem you have been given an array
which will be consisting blooming day of flowers of n flower

You have also given m ans k

where m is number of bookeh you have to make
and k is number of flowers consisting in each bookeh

so you have to find the minimun number of days to make that bookeh

all of the flower will bloom in the maximum day

but you have to return the minimum number of days

There is a cache cause you also have to take the adjacent flowers

The days will mainly range from the minimum day and the maximum

use binary search each time loop through the array and increase the counter

counter stores how many flowers had bloomed 

once it get to a unbloomed flower make the counter to zero but
before making it to zero divide it with  the number of flowers you required to make 1 bookeh

i.e. you will make that much bookeh

but but but at last check weather the number of bookeh is equal to the finding one if so then return that day else do your binary search

remember that once you find the ans try to minimize the day

TC -> O(N) + O(log2 (max - min + 1)) * O(N);
SC -> O(1);
