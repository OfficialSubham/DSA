I have to find out the squareroot of a given number using binary search

If you linearly travis of all number from 1 until you reach
the greater or equal to the number of squareroot

if it becomes equal return it
if it becomes greater than return the previous number

Just do binary search in an imaginary array

like take low as 1
high as the given number/2

if the square of mid gives a value greater than the number
then eliminate the right

use maybe method where you store the number in the ans
if the square of mid is lesser than the given then just store it in the ans

high will always be storing my answer
