In this i just have to return a boolean

wheather the number is present in the array

Brute -> linear search

TC -> O(n);
SC -> O(1);

Optimal ->

  Use binary search just like BS-4 in sorted 1 problem

  but there is a chache
  the array has duplicates
  hence you also have to check weather
  all the number in low high and mid are equal if so and if you are checking this this means the mid is not the answer and as they are equal and not the answer so just move the low pointer bit high and high pointer bit low

TC -> O(log2 N) worst case O(n/2) when you are shrinking;
SC -> O(1);
