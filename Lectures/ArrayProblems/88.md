88. Merge Sorted Array without using any extra spaces

In this problem i have to sort two arrays without using any extra spaces

I.e. that i have to edit the original arrays into an overall sorted array

Brute ->
  Take a extra space then just sort
  both the array into the new array
  at last add all the items in the first array until it reaches the
  last index then start to add to the next array

TC -> O(3N);
SC -> O(2N);

Optimal ->
  Start with two pointers
  one in the end of the first array
  other one is in the start of the second array
  just check each time if some thing on the first one is greater
  than the second one then swap them
  if not, since the arrays are sorted then the next will also not
  so break the loop

  At last sort the both array

TC -> O(N log N) + O(M log M) + O(min(m, n));
SC -> O(1);

Other Optimal ->
  Gap method
  Comes from shell sort
  Here first sum up the all the size then take the seil value of it
  than assign it as gap value
  take a left pointer at 0 and right pointer with a gap of the gap value
  once the right gets out of the array stop the loop
  then again make the gap value / 2 and take the seil value of it
  continue this loop until the gap becomes one

TC -> O(log2 m + n) * O(m + n);
SC -> o(1);
