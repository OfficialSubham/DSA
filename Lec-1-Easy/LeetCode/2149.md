2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

The problem contains same number of positive and negatives in the Array
we just have to return a new array but in an alternate way of positive
and negative we have also maintain the order of them.

Brute ->
  Two method :

1st (My) ->
  First take three empty vectors
  run a loop and just differentiate the negative and positive
  in two of the vectors
  then again run a loop to add it to the last vector in alternate
  secquence

2ns ->
  Using array
  take two array of half of original sizes and differentiate
  the negative and positive
  it can be observed that even indexes contains negatives
  and odd indexes contains positive now add it to a new array
  then return it

TC -> O(n + n / 2)
SC -> O(n)

Optimal ->
  intialize a vector of same size
  then use your brain and try to find how to put the number
  in odd and even position according to -ve and +ve
  -ve = even
  +ve = odd

TC -> O(n)
SC -> O(n)

2nd Variety ->

  Here the number of positive and negative are not same
  so if there is any remaining in the array just add it
  without any alternation

  just return back to the brute force

  first differentiate the positive and negative array
  then check weather the positive is more or negative is more

  for more +ve

  then run a loop upto the negative size and add the alternate number
  up until negative get ended

  then run a loop from the end of negative index
  start to add the value from the negative size * 2
  upto the size of positive
  just add it to the array

  for more -ve

  just do the vice versa of the +ve one

TC -> O(2N)
SC -> O(N)
