PS -> 189. Rotate Array

My approach : 
    I used my brute approach where i insert the last element 
    into the first position upto the given times
    Then i removed the elements from the last.
    My method is good but it takes O(N) TC.
    for large it exceeds time limit
Optimal :
        for k = 3 (rotation)

        Normal Array =  1 2 3 4 5 6 7

        Rotated Array = 5 6 7 1 2 3 4

        use inbuilt reverse function

        divide into two side for necessity

        reverse left side

                    4 3 2 1 5 6 7
        **Cause there is three movement to right **
        so first reverse the element upto the just before the last element 
        which will move
        then reverse those last element
                    4 3 2 1 7 6 5

        now reverse the full array

                    5 6 7 1 2 3 4 
        got the required rotated array
