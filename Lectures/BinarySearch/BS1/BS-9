In this problem i have to find peak of an array

peak is a number which is greater than its both side number
if the array contains multiple peak than just return any one of them

Brute ->
  Linear search but there is a trick of only one if statement

  if((i == 0 || nums[i] > nums[i - 1])&&(i == n - 1 || nums[i] > nums[i+1])) {
                return i;
            }
  it is a easily understandable code try

TC -> O(N);
SC -> O(1);

Optimal ->
  if we just have one peak
  either peak on left side
  either peak on right side
  mid is in the peak

  if the mid is on increasing curve
  i.e. the left element is smaller
  then the peak will always be on right

  or vice versa

TC -> O(log2 n);
SC -> O(1);
