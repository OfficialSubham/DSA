Both the Problems are exactly same

Painter Partition problem state
  You have given an array and number of painters
  you have to split the array according to the number of painters
  and have to findout that how can i split the array in such a way
  that the maximum number of days taking by a painter
  is the minimum from the other maximum

Split array largest sum state
  You have given an array and a number k
  you have to split the array into k sub arrays
  and then you have to find out the maximum sum of all subarrays
  but the maximum should be minimum

This problem is also same as the allocate books just follow that
