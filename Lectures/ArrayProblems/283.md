PS -> 283. Move Zeroes

My Approach : 
    I used a for loop in the bruteforce method 
    there i loop through the whole array and then if there is any 0 i found
    i remove it and increase the zero counter by 1
    then at last i use insert method to add multiple zeros at the end
    It takes O(N) TC
Optimal : 
    first for loop will find the index of zero 
    then assign the index to a variable
    then check wheather there is any zero or not
    if there is
    then start another loop next from the zero upto which 
    you get a non-zero number
    then swap the number and change the index of the variable by 1 as the zero
    will move forward
