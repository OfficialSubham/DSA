KOKO eating Bananas problem

we have given piles like array of multiple bananas

and we have to find the minimum number of speed of eating bananas by koko
so that he can finish all the bananas within the deadline
Yeah we had also given a deadline of eating bananas

We have to take the ceit value of eating banana

like if speed of koko if 2 bananas/hr then if there is 3 bananas
then we know it will take 1.5hr but we have to consider it as 2 hr



Brute ->
 Do a linear search check each time from 1 to upto a certain number
 of eating banana rate each time increase it do this until
 it becomes lesser than equal to deadline

Optimal ->
  first find the max in the piles
  it will be you range of eating bananas per hour
  then define another function which will give you time taken to complete to eat that much banana
  do that function in a binary search
  whose range is from 0 upto the the maxi
  subtle bug take piles[i] + hr - 1 / hr in order to ceil the value
  cause every double and is not working
  use your brain and try to find out how can i get the maximum but also
  lesser than the deadline

TC -> O(n) * O(log2 maximumElement);
SC -> O(1);
