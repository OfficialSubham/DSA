In this problem i have to find out the nth root of an integer

like n=3 for m = 27 is 3root27 = 3

if you won't able to find its nth root then return -1

Do this using binary search

Brute ->
  Do a linear search

TC -> O(n);
SC -> O(1);

Optimal ->
  Use binay search just like the ans in the previous questions to find out the root 
  everytime store the ans and al last just check weather the number you got is actually the nth power if so return it or else return -1

  In the function where you get the int of your number's with the given power
  check each time where it crosses the m once it crosses it return that value cause once it crosses it you don't want to take that

  the test case will fail so take long long

TC -> O(log2 m) * O(log2 n)(for getting the power each time)
