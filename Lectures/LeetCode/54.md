54. Spiral Matrix

In this problem i have print all the elements in a Matrix
in a spiral manner

It is like go each element from the top once it reaches the last
in the first row then go till to the bottom then to left then to top
continue this until you reach the last element

Only one way to solve this

Brute, Optimal ->
  consider 4 variables
  top
  right
  bottom
  left

  top would be start from 0 and left will also start from 0
  bottom would be size of matrix - 1
  right will be size of matrix[0] - 1

  run a while loop until top lesser than bottom
  and left lesser than right

  first loop will be doing this ->
    row will be constant so it will the top
    column is variable so it will start from left upto right
  then top will increase its value cause the next start is from top

  second loop will be doing this ->
    column is constant so it will be the right
    row is a variable so the row starts from top upto the bottom
  then the right decreases as its value will be used to the next start

Now there is a jargon
  before the third loop you have a if statement
  it checks weather the top is still lesser than equal to bottom
  come from right to left as usual
  then decrease the bottom so that it shifts upward

Now again a check where you check weather left is still lesser than
equal to right

then do the statement and increase the left and run this in a while loop


code ->
 vector<int> outputVec;
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        int top = 0;
        int right = n - 1;
        int bottom = m - 1;
        int left = 0;
        while(top <= bottom && left <= right) {
            for(int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
                outputVec.push_back(matrix[top][i]);
            }
            top++;
            for(int i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
                outputVec.push_back(matrix[i][right]);
            }
            right--;
            if(top <= bottom) {
                for(int i = right; i >= left; i--) {
                outputVec.push_back(matrix[bottom][i]);
                }
                bottom--;
            }
            if(left <=right) {
                for(int i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                    outputVec.push_back(matrix[i][left]);
                }
                left++;

            }
        }
        return outputVec;
