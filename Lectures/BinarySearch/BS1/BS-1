Binary Search to find X in sorted array

Binary search is always can be done in a sorted things

This algo checks by visiting half of the arry
It is like after visiting half of the array if the given number is smaller than the current number then check the left half or else the right half this is how the algo works

Thaught process


Take three variable
low mid and high

each time make a mid which is low + high / 2

if the target is equal to mid then return the mid
if the target is lesser than the mid
i.e. the left portion is also lesser hence check from the next upto the high
if the target is greater then the mid value then just deacrease the low
to one lesser than the mid as the right portion is also bigger

this is possible only because the array is sorted

use recursion or while loop to solve this problem
very easy

TC -> O(Log2 N);
SC -> O(1);
