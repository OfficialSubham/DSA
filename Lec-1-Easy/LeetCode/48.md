48. Rotate Image

In this problem I have to rotate a matrix by 90 degree
the matrix is 2D

Brute ->
  Try to find a pattern on changing the position of digits
  take a empty matrix of same size and length
  if you can't think a pattern then look at this
  loop through each digits of the matrix
  the pattern you should recognize is that each digits changing
  their position with respect to size and the row number
  - The row would be same as the j index but the column would be changed
    in this manner size - i - 1 try to figure it out of your own from here

TC -> O(N*N)
SC -> O(N*N)

Optimal ->
  Don't take a new matrix
  we have to swap few numbers
  if you carefully notice you would find that the left diagonal is not
  changing in the rotate matrix
  here we first transpose the matrix
  transpose -> rows becomes columns and columns becomes rows
  for transposing we have to run the first loop upto size - 1
  the inside loop will start from the next of the upper loop
  just swap the numbers with each other

TC -> O(N * N/2) + O(N + N/2);
SC -> O(1)
