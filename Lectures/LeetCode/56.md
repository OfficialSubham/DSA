56. Merge Intervals

In this problem i have to return intervals

it is like you are given arrays inside an array

now you have to some how able to find a sequence

Where it is like ending

like 1 2 3 4

hence it interval would be 1, 4

Brute ->

  First sort the array
  iterate through the interval
  check if anything is in the all interval array
  if some thing is there
  then just check weather the current element's last number is equal to
  or falls inside the last number of that one
  if so then continue
  if not then take it as the first interval
  then on iterating over the other just check that their
  first number is falls under the second
  if so then just check the last digit of the greater one is its range

TC -> O(N log N) + nearly O(2N)
SC -> O(N)

Optimal ->
  Run it in one iteration
  simple if else statement
  find some pattern


HINT ->
  if the ans is empty or it's back's number is lesser
  then the current's first number then just add it as new array
  if not than update the last number

TC -> O(N log N) + O(N);
SC -> O(N)
