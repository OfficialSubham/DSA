This algo states like this

take a variable with minimum number possible
take sum with 0
start a pointer from start to end
run a loop upto the end
each time first add the number to the sum
then check weather it is greater than max if so then assign it.
then check sum is negative if so then change it to 0 cause taking
negative forward doesnot increase the sum.
this is how this algo works and you can find a maximum sum in an array
