Famous two sum problem

Brute ->
  two for loops check every other element
  some condition
    -> don't check the same element
    -> inside loop can start from the next of the outside loop
TC -> O(n*n)
SC -> O(1)

Better ->
  Use hash
  just check evertime weather the target - currentNum is present
  in the hash
  if so return the index from the hash
  else just add the num to the map with the index

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)

Optimal ->
  If not allowed to use map
  Then first sort the array
  then use two pointer approach
  if is like run a loop until they become equal or overlaps eachother
  every time check weather the current value is bigger
  than the target if so move the right pointer
  if not move the left pointer at last return the left and right index
