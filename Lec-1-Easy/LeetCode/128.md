128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

In this problem I had to find a longest Consecutive Sequence

it is like if the array contains 1 then i have to look for 2
if is has also 2 then look for 3 doing this so on and so forth

until i found the longest sequence

Brute ->
  define a linear search function where the function takes an array
  and a number
  if the number contains in the array then it will return true
  or else it will return false

  run a for loop to go through each of the number
  define a counter starts with 1 inside it
  store the current number in a variable in order to increase that
  run a while loop inside it in order to find the next number
  each time increase the number and counter
  at last check the maximum between the counter and maximum length

TC -> O(N*N);
SC -> O(1);

Better ->
  sort the array
  assign a variable with minimum value
  if the previous value in the array is not equal to the
  assigned variable and also the current value is not equal to the
  assigned value than assigned it the current value
  if they are equal then just increase the counter by 1
  and assigned it to the longest length

TC -> O(N) + O(NLogN);
SC -> O(1);

Optimal ->
  add every element in a set
  then run a loop and checks weather previous element is already
  in the set if so then do nothing
  if not then check for the next element and increase the count
  do the same as the rest

TC -> O(N) + O(3N) or worst O(N*N);
SC -> O(N);
