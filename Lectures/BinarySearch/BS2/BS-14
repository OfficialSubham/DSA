In this problem I have to find the smallest divisor

This problem states that i have to find the maxi of mini

like you have given a threshold number
you have to find the least possible integer by which if you divide all the numbers in the array and then add them you will get lesser than equal to the value of threshold

you are trying with 1 2 3 so on and so forth 
the maximum number to divide all the number in the array would be the maxi in the array

Try to read the question carefully
once you understand the question properly half of the problem has solved

Brute ->
  I applied simple brute force

TC -> O(N*N) + O(N);
SC -> O(1);


Optimal ->
  Try to use binary search on answers

It pretty easy

TC -> O(log2(maxi) * O(n)) + O(N);
SC -> O(1);



HINT ->
  the ans would be from 1 to the maximum element
  the low and high will ultimately change their polarity
