229. Majority Element II

In this problem i have to find the number which appears more
n / 3 times in the array


Same as the previous problem of Majority Element 1

Brute ->
  Use two loops each time check how many times that number appear
  if it is more that n / 3 then add to the returning array

TC -> O(N*N);
SC -> O(1);

Better ->
  Use HASH
  use one loop for storing the frequency of each element
  again iterate through the map
  then check the same condition as above

TC -> O(2N);
SC -> O(N);

Optimal ->
  use the same method as the previous problem's Optimal
  and use your brain to solve this

HINT -> take two count
        cause if you observe you will notice that maximum 2 element
        will be majority
        count increases if the number same and decreases if not
        always check at last weather the element is there more than n / 3
