73. Set Matrix Zeroes

In this matrix i have to iterate through the whole matrix
and if i found zero then i have to convert the  entire row and column
to 0

but the previously contained zero's row and column should be zero
the zero assigned by you will not be considered

Brute approach ->
  Run a loop to iterate through the matrix if you find out zero
  then in a other defined function by you, you should marked the
  entire row and column with -1
  then at last convert all the -1 to 0

TC -> O(N*M) + O(N + M) nearly O(N*N*N);
SC -> O(1);

Better ->
  define two array for row and column
  while iterating through the matrix if you find out
  any zero then assign the row and column to that index as 1

  iterate through the matrix and check if the row or the column
  is marked as 1 if then change the number to zero
  
TC -> O(2N * M)
SC -> O(N) + O(M)

Optimal ->
  Since the iterating in the matrix takes minimum of n*n
  so We have to now optimise the space complexity

  Just like the better approach we just make the row and column
  inside the matrix but there is a common formed
  so start the row from the next to it and make that first
  element in an other variable

  Just iterate through the array instead of doing in the other array as 1
  change the row and column in the inside array

  Run a loop through the array in the reverse fashion i.e. from the end
  up until the first row and first column
  then run the first row from the last cause you take a separate variable for this

  then change it accordingly

TC -> O(2N*N);
SC -> O(1);
