This is the leetcode 26th problem and my I guess 2nd problem after DSA.
This txt will become too long cause this is my first docs for my revision of every problem 

PS -> 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

My Method: 
    I caried a variable to store the previous element.
    start a loop for the whole array then checks weather the previous emement matches the next element if so i will remove it.
    if it doesnot matches then i will change the value of the previous element to new element
    DONE.

Second Approach:
    This is two pointer apporach which is like i and j
    using while loop
    j checks the elemet != i element 
    if so then add it to the next element after i and increase the value of i
    do this until j reaches the end
    atlast erase the element from the i+1 as they all are similar upto the end
    then return the size which is i+1
